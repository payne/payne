I'm a Computer Programmer living in Omaha, NE.  My day job is great: developing software with a team.  My part time job as a Metropolitan Community Collge corporate trainer is also fun: I serve as the technical project manager for [MCC Code School](https://mccneb.edu/CodeSchool.aspx).  It's a nine-month night school for people who want to become software developers.
